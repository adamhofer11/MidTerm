>##### An insight to my personal life

## Student
I am a student at the Universtiy of Missouri Studying IT, on track to graduate in the spring of 2025.
>I chose information technology because I wanted to pursue my technology obsession and help innovate new forms of technology.

I am in the fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi, where we all work to better ourselves by:
> - Building friendships that will last a lifetime.
> - Hold eachother countable and to high standards.
> - Meeting and building great connections and expanding knowledge.
> - Learning how to take leadership actions through positions on the board.

## **Personal Hobbies**
> #### Sports
> > > I love to watch the St. Louis Cardinals or the Blues whenever I get the chance. Those have been my two favorite sports teams for as long as I can remember. Some of my favorite memories are being a kid at Busch Stadium.
> > #### Snow skiing
> > > For a person who has lived in Missouri their whole life, I am obsessed with it. I have gone every winter for 14 years, and for the past couple years I have gone on every break I have. 
> > #### Video Games
> > > Video games have been a staple to my life for a long time. One of my earliest memories is getting the Playstation 2 for my 4th birthday. Any free time I have is usually spent playing games. I play all sorts of games but competitive multiplayers are my favoirte. Having a very competitive mindset drove me to try to become the best of best. Which I never quite made it there but, I have reached up to top 3% in the world in games that have over 350 million active players. Video games is actually the whole reason why I know anything about how a computer works. It was video games that drove me to learn how computers work so I could build one myself. I ended up building my first computer when I was 14.
